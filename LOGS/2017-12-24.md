Wii remote gets in today, will probably experiment with installing it and the nunchuck and getting button patterns recognized. After that it will just be a bunch of soldering and drilling and getting timings down for lights and sounds.

Note to self: test sounds playing over music, see if there's any problems.

Thinking of redoing the paint job to a black and gold scheme after making the minor repairs.

Note to self: backup the golden raider's SD card regularly to prevent data loss.
