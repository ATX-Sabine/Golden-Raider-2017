Added login scripts and users to the ship's computer. If the raider ever falls out of ATX hands, the login they'll get is very well locked down so that they don't mess with my systems.

learned about [SWIG and C++] and wrapped an existing C++ module for the SX1509 GPIO expanders with Python, will start testing it tonight to see if it actually, y'know, worked.

The ship's computer board arrived today -- once the extra GPIO expanders get in we'll really get going on construction. Luckily working on spare parts I salvaged from the lab will allow ve to prepare the code and get a good bit of the heavy lifting done without waiting for parts.

Grabbing a breadboard and wires needed to test the SX1509 Python wrapper...

Set up an RGB LED on a SX1509 and adding examples inside the module itself.

UGH compiling swig modules on raspis has had me at it for hours. Documenting the process.
