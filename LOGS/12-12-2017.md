## Dissassembly completed on the Golden Raider

Both ships sat in carbonite for 48 to undo the major glue points -- the fact that the imperials glue their ships together is not all that surprising.

After freezing, I started with the test ship I nabbed from a particularly trusting stormtrooper -- I think it was Pvt. Rosner. I found that the proper disassembly directions are:

* Remove the bridge
* Remove the side fins
* Seperate the bottom from the top hull
* Pop out the engines

The engines weren't even glued in. Imperials, I tell ya.

I also managed to find a reputable parts smug--er--dealer to get me the new ship computer: A Raspberry Pi Zero W. This will give the Golden Raider Mk 2 aceess to wireless interfaces! I'm excited to mess with the possibilities.

I also have decided upon seondary control systems: 1 or 2 SX1509 GPIO expanders. These will give us the ability to fade lights, control more outputs, and they take surprisingly little power to make.

I'll also need a boatload of LEDs, a stencil to make an imperial shade-- I know, I know, but the Squad comes before my personal artistic tastes-- some speakers, an amplifier that also serves as an audio interface to the ship's main computer (if I'm going to have a creation of mine play that damned march, it'll do it right), and a few other parts-- [DOCS/PARTS.md](../DOCS/PARTS.md) should contain an updated list.

Tonight, I have set up a copy of the ship's main computer, and I'll be detailing the setup for when the Golden Raider's computer arrives.

Hm. Seems there's no SX1509 Driver in Python for the Raspi yet. We'll just have to fix that.

Found [WiringPi](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi-Python) to be the best bet for GPIO control library ([API here](https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi-Python/blob/master/bindings.i))

Need a new hand drill, ordered one that'll be here shortly.

Decided to add a TTL serial hookup in case I need to get in without wifi or HDMI. Need to figure out haw to make it acessible from the outside.
