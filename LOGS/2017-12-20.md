Things are starting to move-- got the Adafruit speaker bonnet, speakers, and the 2 GPIO expanders. Plotted where the speakers will go.

The Thursday stream will be the build -- soldering the bonnet and expanders to the onboard computer, getting it set up.

Thinking about upping the paint job a bit...plans will be detailed here once I finalize them.

Working on just straight pythonizing the SX1509 drivers-- wrappers just made me mad.
