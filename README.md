# The Golden Raider 2017

## The What Now?

The 512th ATX Squadron won the Golden Raider in the November 2017 regionals, and they entrusted me to deck it out with LEDs, music, etc. 

## What's the plan?

We want bridge and engine lighting, an imperial logo shade on the large engine, sound, and basically anything that'll give it that ATX flair.

## OK, How do I learn more?
